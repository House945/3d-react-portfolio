# 3D Developer Portfolio

This is a developer portfolio built with React, Vite, and Three.js only to remind myself how to build in React ;)

## Installation

To install the app, run the following command:

npm install

## Usage

To run the app in development mode, run the following command:

npm run dev

This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

To build the app for production, run the following command:

npm run build
This will generate a production build of the app in the `dist` folder.
